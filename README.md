# ☄️ AstroShield – Interactive Asteroid Impact Simulation (Prototype)

🚀 Prototype developed for **NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025 – Jabalpur Edition (Round 2)**  

## 🌍 Project Overview
AstroShield is an **interactive asteroid impact simulation tool** designed to help people understand the potential consequences of Near-Earth Objects (NEOs).  

This prototype demonstrates the **core functionality**:
- Enter asteroid parameters (diameter, velocity, density, angle).  
- Calculate impact energy, crater size, shockwave radius, and estimated casualties.  
- Visualize the impact zone on a simple map.  

Future scope includes mitigation strategies, VR mode, and integration with NASA’s live datasets.
